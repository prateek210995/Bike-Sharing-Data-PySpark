# Bike-Sharing-Data-PySpark

The Bike Sharing dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository for the visualization and analysis of the data using PySpark. Machine Learning regression models such as Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Linear regression, and Decision Tree are built using Spark's machine learning library MLlib with APIs in Python to forecast the demand for bike rentals. Also, Tableau software is used for visualization purposes.
